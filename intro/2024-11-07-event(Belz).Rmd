<!-- The University also acknowledges and is grateful to the Traditional Owners, Elders and Knowledge Holders of all Indigenous nations and clans who have been instrumental in our reconciliation journey. -->

<!-- We recognise the unique place held by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the original owners and custodians of the lands and waterways across the Australian continent, with histories of continuous connection dating back more than 60,000 years. We also acknowledge their enduring cultural practices of caring for Country. -->

<!-- We pay respect to Elders past, present and future, and acknowledge the importance of Indigenous knowledge in the Academy. As a community of researchers, teachers, professional staff and students we are privileged to work and learn every day with Indigenous colleagues and partners. -->

<!-- In making this Acknowledgment of Country we commit to respectful and responsible conduct towards all others according to the Traditional lores of this land, particularly at times of formal ceremony. -->

We pay respect to the traditional and original owners of this land, the Wurundjeri Woi-wurrung and Bunurong peoples, to pay respect to those that have passed before us.

<br>

We extend our respect also to the traditional owners of the lands from which people in our livestream are joining.

## Challenges of High Dimension Low Sample Size Data Analysis

<!-- .circle-image-200.fl[ -->
<!-- <img src="images/Shane-Richards.jpg">] -->

###**Professor J. S. Marron, University of North Carolina**

*Steve is a statistician / data scientist who invents methodology for gaining insights from integrated and complex data sources, with an emphasis on managing uncertainty. His current major collaborations include research with genomicists working on complex high dimensional data collected to study cancer, with computer scientists focussed on the statistics of shape in image analysis applications, and with physicians taking a data centric approach to the notoriously hard to treat disease of arthritis.*
<!-- Such collaborations have led him to become a pioneer in developing strong connections between statistics and non-standard areas of mathematics, including geometry (fundamental to shape analysis) and topological data analysis. -->
<!-- Steve is Amos Hawley Distinguished Professor of Statistics and Operations Research at the University of North Carolina.  -->
<!-- His book Object Oriented Data Analysis with Ian Dryden appeared in 2021 -->
