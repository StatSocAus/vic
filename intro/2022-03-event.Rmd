Damjan Vukcevic is a Senior Lecturer in Statistical Genomics at the University of Melbourne. He has contributed extensively to human genomics research, beginning with his DPhil studies at the University of Oxford and continuing to his current role as a group leader at Melbourne Integrative Genomics. Damjan has worked both in academia and industry. His recent projects span many fields beyond genomics, including ecology, respiratory medicine, astrophysics and, most recently, election integrity. He has provided expert advice to the insurance sector and policy submissions to Federal Parliament. Damjan is a long-standing contributor to the statistics community in Australia and the SSA in particular, about to conclude his 4-year term as President/Vice-President of SSA Vic.

Philip B. Stark is a Distinguished Professor of Statistics at the University of California, Berkeley. He is the originator of risk-limiting audits, a rigorous method that ensures that tabulation errors did not change the reported election outcomeâ€”or (with pre-specified probability) corrects the outcome if it is incorrect. Prof. Stark serves on the Board of Advisors of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission and has consulted for the Secretaries of State of California, Colorado, and New Hampshire. He has testified to state legislatures and as an expert witness in state and federal cases involving election integrity. His research also traverses many other fields, including applications to astrophysics, cosmology, ecology, health, nutrition, business and commerce.
