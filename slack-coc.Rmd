title: SSA Community Slack Code of Conduct
---

The Statistical Society of Australia’s (SSA) Victorian branch aims to support the statistical community of Victoria and Tasmania, which includes students and practitioners of statistics across many varied fields and occupations. To this end, the Victorian branch has created a Slack workspace to enable communication between members of our community, which is also open to individuals outside of Victoria and Tasmania.

At the Victorian branch we take making our community safe, friendly, and free from harassment and abuse seriously. In order to participate in this workspace all individuals must read and by participating in the Slack community agree to be bound by this Code of Conduct.

# Summary

Be respectful, be kind.

Abusive behaviour is never tolerated.

You must use your full name and an image of yourself in your profile in order to participate in the community. Anonymous users who do not edit their profile after being given a warning by the Slack admin team will be removed from the Slack channel.

Should you have any issues while participating in the Slack community you can reach out to one of the Slack admin team via Direct Message (DM):

- Belinda Maher
- Ben Harrap
- Emi Tanaka

Violations of this code of conduct may result in immediate and permanent expulsion from the Slack community.

Any decisions made by the Slack admin team are final.

# Introduction

This Code of Conduct is written and applies specifically to users of the SSA Vic Slack community. While the SSA has a national Code of Conduct for Members, this Code of Conduct borrows from the national Code of Conduct but is written specifically to govern behaviour of those participating in the SSA Vic Slack community. It should be noted that this Code of Conduct does not overwrite or relieve Members from being bound by the national Code of Conduct.

# Standards of behaviour

The SSA Vic branch is committed to making the Slack community a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for everyone, regardless of gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, age, physical appearance, body size, race, or similar personal characteristics. 

Examples of behaviours that contribute to creating a positive environment include:

- using welcoming and inclusive language;
- being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences; 
- gracefully accepting constructive criticism;
- focusing on what is best for the community;
- showing empathy towards other community members.

Examples of **unacceptable behaviour** include:

- the use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances;
- trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks;
- public or private harassment;
- publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission;
- other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

Whether the topic of discussion is about statistics or not, we ask that you take a moment before posting or commenting to consider whether the topic or the language you are using may make others uncomfortable, and refrain from doing so if you believe it may. As we state in the first summary point, be kind. We also ask everyone to be respectful in their communications. Discussions of statistical topics are encouraged, however differences of opinion should remain respectful and personal attacks and harassment are never acceptable.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to: harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments related to gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, age, physical appearance, body size, race, or similar personal characteristics; inappropriate use of nudity, sexual images, and/or sexually explicit language; threats of physical or non-physical harm; deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or recording; and unwelcome sexual attention.

Any member of a hate organization, or supporter of such, is not welcome.

# Participation and acceptable content

When using the SSA Vic community Slack workspace:

- Do not publish text/screenshots of anything shared in Slack without explicit consent from the author. This includes screenshots of private messages to public channels, as well as conversations on public channels to anywhere outside of the SSA Vic community Slack.
- Promotion of commercial products and services is allowed if it is relevant to the group’s purpose, does not saturate communications within Slack and the promoters have demonstrated other contributions to the statistical community.

Content must not contain illegal or infringing content. You should only publish content if you have the right to do so. This includes complying with all software license agreements or other intellectual property restrictions. For example, redistributing an MIT-licensed module with the copyright notice removed, would not be allowed. You will be responsible for any violation of laws or others’ intellectual property rights.

Content must not be malware. For example, content (code, video, pictures, words, etc.) which is designed to maliciously exploit or damage computer systems, is not allowed.

Content name, description, and other visible metadata must not include abusive, inappropriate, or harassing content.

The support channel is available for users to post questions and ask for help on problems they are facing. If you would like help on a statistical problem that may require extensive time commitment, please consider consulting a professional. Please refrain from asking questions related to assessment tasks.

# Violations of the Code of Conduct

If you believe someone is harassing you or is otherwise engaging in behaviours that violate this Code of Conduct please reach out to any of the Slack admin team listed at the start of this document. If your issue is not resolvable by the person you contact and requires discussion by the admin team, the person you contacted will ask you first if you are happy for them to discuss with the broader admin team.

Reports to the admin team will be managed in the strictest confidence and all reports will be investigated. All efforts will be made to protect the anonymity of persons reporting violations. Persons reporting violations of the Code of Conduct may request that their report remain confidential and that no further action be taken. However, if the Slack admin team deems it necessary for the safety of members, action will be taken, including referral of the report to the Statistical Society of Australia.

Depending on the transgression, consequences of violating the Code of Conduct may vary from a warning and compulsion to cease the violating behaviour to a temporary or permanent ban from the Slack community. Individuals who keep engaging in the violating behaviour will be permanently banned with no option for appeal. Any misconduct will be recorded in SSA Vic internal records.
